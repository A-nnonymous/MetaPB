# MetaPB: A CPU-PIM co-processing load balancer using metaheuristics algorithm.

## 1. Introduction  
  This work aims to alleviate the performance degradation issues in PIM systems caused by suboptimal scheduling. By taking into account the computational capabilities of both the CPU and PIM units, as well as the cost of data transfer between them, task scheduling is optimized from both performance and energy efficiency perspectives. This optimization enables efficient collaboration between the CPU and PIM units.
